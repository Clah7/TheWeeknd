            Early Years Born as Abel Tesfaye on February 16, 1990, in Toronto, Canada, The Weeknd has
            risen to become one of the music industry's leading alternative R&B performers. He is the son of
            Ethiopian immigrants but had little contact with his father, who left the family when The Weeknd
            was just a toddler. His early musical influences ranged from traditional Ethiopian music to the
            "King of Pop," Michael Jackson. In an interview with Vanity Fair, The Weeknd specifically cited
            the impact of Jackson's 1979 hit "Don't Stop 'til You Get Enough," describing it as "the song that
            helped me find my voice. It's the reason I sing."
            Mixtapes, Albums & Songs 'House of Balloons' Never one to shy away from showcasing his
            vocal talents, The Weeknd began recording his efforts while in high school. After dropping out,
            he continued to explore his interest in music and released a free download called House of
            Balloons in 2011. This, along with two more mixtapes, helped propel his career forward. He
            collaborated with Drake on Drake's 2011 album, Take Care, which featured several tracks from
            House of Balloons, and subsequently secured a deal with Universal's Republic Records.
            'Trilogy' The Weeknd's earlier mixtapes were re-released as Trilogy in 2012, which became a
            platinum-selling record for the young artist. Despite his growing popularity, he managed to
            remain relatively hidden from the public eye. The Weeknd declined interviews for an extended
            period and chose to use images of women for his 2013 album, Kiss Land, rather than pictures of
            himself. Some of the mystique he built around himself was intentional, but it also reflected the
            shyness and insecurities that troubled him early in his career.
